## Examining Process Lists
### Viewing Processes with ps
`ps`
```
PID   TTY      TIME     CMD
3702  pts/2    00:00:00 bash
3831  pts/2    00:00:00 ps
```
- `PID`, A unique number for the process
- `TTY`, The terminal that came from for example, `pts/0`, `pts/1`, & `pts/2` are three different terminals.
- `TIME`, The cumulateive CPU time required to run the process.
- `CMD`, Command
    - `[]`, Some commands will have brackets, it indicates process that are currently swapped out from physical memory to virtual memory on the hard drive.

The `ps` command supports three different styles of command-line options.
- `Unix-style`, Preceded by a dash.
    - `-ef`, To view see every process running on the server.
- `Berkley Software Distribution (BSD)-style`, No preceded by a dash.
- `GNU Long`, Preceded by a double dash.

### Understanding Process States
- `Sleeping Mode`, Processes that are swapped into virtual memory, the kernel places processes into sleep mode while the process is waiting for an event.
    - `Interruptible Sleep Mode`, The kernel sends a signal, the process will receives the signal and immediately wake up.
    - `Uninterruptible Sleep Mode`, Only wakes up based on an external event.
    - `Zombie`, The parent process hasn't been acknowledged that the child process has ended.

### Selecting Processes with ps
- `a`, 
- `-A`, `-e`, 
- `-C CommandList`, 
- `-g GIDList`, `-group GIDList`, Display processes by effective/temporary/alternative group from the GIDList.
- `-G GIDList`, `-Group GIDList`, Display processes by real group from the GIDList.
- `-N`, 
- `p PIDList`, `-p PIDList`, `--pid PIDList`, 
- `-r`, 
- `-t ttyList`, `--tty ttyList`, 
- `-T`, 
- `-u UserList`, `--user UserList`, Display processes by effective/temporary/alternative username or UID from the UseList.
- `-U UserList`, `--User UserList`, Display process by real username or UID from the UserList.
- `x`, 

To see every pocess associated with a particular user or group, employ both **effective/temporary/alternative** & **real** options for example, `ps -u USERNAME -U USERNAME`

### Viewing Processes with top

- `free -h`, Memory useage for physical memory & swap memory.
- `watch COMMAND`, For monitoring process information. This will reissue the command every two seconds.

**Interactive Commands**<br>
By default, top sort the processes based on the `%CPU` value.
- `1`, 
- `b`,
